Time taken: 6 hours just taking too much time to add a bunch of stuff


improvements and stuff I couldn't figure out:
Add search with filters, possibly dynamic.
add back in functionality in form for image upload, how to do this without making api post route too convoluted.


how to pass wtforms validator errors through js axios??:
possibly pass the errors in axios error handling, need this validators to handle a lot of small problems with the db entries, like default image and correct data.

add update form, pass template using js to change it from add to update probably and use same form helpers.

add delete button, use delete api route

clean up js, rewrite some stuff in jquery syntax. 

how or what what be good examples of implementing the js using classes?? as mentioned in the further study.


more testing
